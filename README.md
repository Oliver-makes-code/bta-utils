# BTA Utils

Initially started as a controller fix,
this is the dumping ground for small non-modded-compatible QoL features.
Everything is toggleable in the config.

So far we have
- SDL Controller input
  - This only works on Linux and Windows atm
- Discord Chat Link
- Crop trample disable

No external dependencies are needed to run this mod.
